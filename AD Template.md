Sure, here is a template with descriptions for an architectural description document based on the principles laid out in the book "Software Systems Architecture: Working With Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives":

**Architectural Description Document (ADD)**

**1. Introduction**

* Briefly introduce the system and its purpose.
* State the scope of the architectural description.
* Identify the stakeholders and their interests.
* Summarize the key principles and guidelines that have guided the architectural design.

**2. Business Viewpoint**

* Describe the business goals and objectives that the system is intended to achieve.
* Identify the key business processes and their relationship to the system.
* Define the system's non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.).
* Outline the business constraints and assumptions that influence the architecture.

**3. Functional Viewpoint**

* Describe the system's overall architecture and its high-level components.
* Define the system's main functions and their interactions.
* Identify the data flows and data structures within the system.
* Specify the interfaces between the system and its external environment.

**4. Development Viewpoint**

* Describe the development approach and methodologies used to create the system.
* Define the system's software components and their implementation details.
* Specify the technologies, tools, and frameworks used in the development process.
* Outline the development lifecycle and its phases.

**5. Deployment Viewpoint**

* Describe the system's deployment architecture and its physical components.
* Specify the hardware and software platforms required for deployment.
* Define the network topology and communication protocols.
* Outline the operational procedures for managing and maintaining the system.

**6. Implementation Viewpoint**

* Provide detailed diagrams and illustrations of the system's architecture.
* Use appropriate notations and standards to represent the architectural elements.
* Include rationale and explanations for architectural decisions and trade-offs.
* Document the system's configuration and customization options.

**7. Evolution Viewpoint**

* Describe the system's adaptability and scalability to meet future needs.
* Identify the potential growth areas and performance requirements for the future.
* Outline the migration strategy for future enhancements and updates.
* Document the process for addressing potential architectural changes and modifications.

**8. Security Viewpoint**

* Describe the security requirements, policies, and measures implemented in the system.
* Identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities.
* Outline the security controls and safeguards to protect the system and its data.
* Document the procedures for managing security incidents and breaches.

**9. Quality Viewpoint**

* Describe the software quality attributes (reliability, maintainability, usability, etc.) prioritized for the system.
* Specify the quality assurance processes and testing methodologies employed.
* Outline the mechanisms for measuring and tracking system quality.
* Define the process for addressing quality issues and defects.

**10. Appendix**

* Include additional supporting documentation, such as diagrams, prototypes, and code snippets.
* Reference relevant standards, guidelines, and architectural patterns used in the design.
* Provide glossaries of terms and acronyms used throughout the document.
