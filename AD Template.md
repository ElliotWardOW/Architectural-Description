**Architectural Description Document (ADD)**

**1. Introduction**

An architectural description shows the system as a multifaceted structure, not just the technical underpinnings of the software. It attempts to communicate understanding the system through multiple viewpoints, like the business, operational, and social perspectives, allowing engineers and architects to craft an architecture that balances various stakeholder needs. By employing this viewpoint-driven approach, the architectural design equips software architects with an approach to designing systems that are not just technically sound, but also aligned with the bigger picture, ensuring stakeholder satisfaction and long-term success.  Although principally intended as a design tool, the architectural description can also provide a means of documenting the system with different views for different stakeholders.

* Briefly introduce the system and its purpose.
* State the scope of the architectural description.
* Identify the stakeholders and their interests.
